## HttpRequest

A HttpRequest object describes all the incoming data about the current request - what parameters were provided, any headers from the browser, the URI that was requested.  Each platform must provide a consistent implementation of each of the available methods.

See the [HttpRequest API documentation](http://ufront.net/api/ufront/web/context/HttpRequest.html).
