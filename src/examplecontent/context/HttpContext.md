## HttpContext

A HttpContext wraps up the HttpRequest, the HttpResponse, any session, authentication and generally useful information - it is a single object that gives you access into every part of the current request / response.

See the [HttpContext API documentation](http://ufront.net/api/ufront/web/context/HttpContext.html).
